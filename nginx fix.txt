If you're receiving a `413 Request Entity Too Large` error from Nginx when using Django, it usually means that the client is trying to upload a file that exceeds the maximum file size allowed by Nginx.

To fix this:

1. **Increase the maximum request body size in Nginx**:

   Open your Nginx configuration file. This could be located in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`, or the specific configuration file for your site within the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory.

   Locate the `server` block, and within that block, add or modify the following line:

   ```
   client_max_body_size 100M;
   ```

   The above will set the maximum upload size to 100 Megabytes. You can adjust the `100M` to any other value that suits your needs.

2. **Reload Nginx**:

   After making the change, you'll need to reload Nginx to apply the new settings:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

3. **Increase the maximum request body size in Django (if using Django's own file upload handlers)**:

   If you're using Django's built-in file upload handlers, you might also need to adjust the `DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE` setting in your Django `settings.py`:

   ```python
   # settings.py
   DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 104857600  # 100MB
   ```

   This setting determines the maximum size (in bytes) that a request's body may be before a `SuspiciousOperation` exception is raised. Adjust the value according to your needs.

4. **Check Application Middleware**:

   If you have any middleware in your Django application that checks or limits the size of request bodies, ensure that it's also configured to accept larger requests.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `413 Request Entity Too Large` error in your Django application served by Nginx. Remember to adjust the maximum size values appropriately based on your application's requirements.
